            <p>
              Stress cards work because they interrupt automatic thinking patterns. When you are stressed, your brain is in a "tunnel vision" mode.
            </p>
            <p>
              By forcing you to answer a specific question (e.g., "What is the evidence for this thought?"), the card engages your prefrontal cortex—the logical part of your brain—and dampens the emotional response of the amygdala.

              <li><strong>Do one card at a time.</strong> Don't rush.</li>
              <li><strong>Write down the answers.</strong> Writing externalizes the thought.</li>
              <li><strong>Commit to the micro-action.</strong> Insight without action is just entertainment.</li>
